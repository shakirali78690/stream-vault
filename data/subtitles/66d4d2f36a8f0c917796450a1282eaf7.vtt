00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:33.922
<i>Ana, take my car.</i>

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:36.938
I gave you the recorder right?

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:40.499
- Oh, yes.
- And you have all the questions?

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.090
- Yes.
- And you know where you're going?

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:46.724
Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA.

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.393
- I can figure it out.
- You're wearing that?

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:55.804
Okay, a little less talking, more eating.

00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:45.774
Miss Kavanagh?

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.102
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, yes

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.205
Ella... Ella... Okay.

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:55.050
- Mr Grey will see you now.
- Okay.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.837
- This way please.
- Okay.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.219
<i>Mr Grey is in a conference at 11:15.</i>

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:10.011
Right this way.

00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:22.249
Miss Kavanagh, are you alright?

00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:28.773
- Christian Grey.
- I'm Anastasia Steele.

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:33.518
Miss Kavanagh has the flu,
so she asked me to fill in.

00:04:33.553 --> 00:04:36.477
I see, so you're studying
journalism as well?

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:41.590
No. English literature
Kate's my roommate.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.824
As I said, I only have 10 minutes.

00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:45.669
Please, have a seat Miss Steele.

00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:13.447
Thanks.

00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.849
- Ready?
- Whenever you are.

00:05:21.038 --> 00:05:22.230
Okay.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.903
So this is for the special graduation issue

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.252
of the student newspaper.

00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:28.677
Yes I'm giving the commencement address

00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:30.198
at this year's ceremony.

00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.424
You are?

00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:37.158
I mean um… I know.

00:05:40.702 --> 00:05:43.840
You are very young to
have amassed an empire.

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.194
- To what do you owe-
- To what do I owe my success?

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.047
- Yep.
- Seriously?

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:51.412
Yes.

00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:58.693
Business is about people, and
I've always been good at people.

00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:03.141
What motivates them, what inspires them.

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.021
Well maybe you're just lucky

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:13.053
I've always seen, the more hard eye
work, the more luck I seem to have.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.347
The key to my success is
identifying talents in individuals.

00:06:17.636 --> 00:06:21.609
- And harnessing their efforts.
- You're a control freak?

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.333
Oh I exercise control in
all things Miss Steele.

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:33.370
Okay um, your company is involved primarily

00:06:33.394 --> 00:06:35.330
in the telecommunications sector.

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:39.427
Yet you also invest in numerous
agricultural projects.

00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:43.569
Including several in Africa. Is that
something you feel passionate about?

00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:45.420
Feeding the world's poor?

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:47.001
Its smart business.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.599
You don't agree?

00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:54.340
I don't know enough about it.

00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:05.586
I just wonder, if you're heart might be
a bit bigger than you want to let on?

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:09.871
But some people say I don't have a heart.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.004
- Why would they say that?
- Because they know me well.

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:16.834
Continue.

00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:21.728
Do you have any interests outside of work?

00:07:22.406 --> 00:07:24.424
I enjoy various physical pursuits.

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:29.857
You're unmarried, oh
you were adopted at age four.

00:07:29.946 --> 00:07:31.444
That's a matter of public record.

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:34.689
I'm sorry I didn't...

00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:38.223
Do you have an actual
question, Miss Steele?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.268
Yes.

00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:43.365
Are you gay?

00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:51.312
Its written here, I'm just...

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:55.898
No, Anastasia. I'm not gay.

00:07:57.068 --> 00:08:00.089
I apologise, Mr Grey
Kate can be a little-

00:08:00.278 --> 00:08:04.466
- Intrusive?
- Curious.

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:11.334
What about you?

00:08:14.586 --> 00:08:17.165
Why don't you ask me
something you wanna know?

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.260
Earlier you said that there are some
people who know you well.

00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:31.010
Why do I have the feeling
that that is not true?

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.564
Mr Grey, your next meeting
is in the conference room.

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:38.527
Cancel it please, we're not finished here.

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:39.748
Yes sir.

00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:42.684
No I um… I can go.

00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:44.733
- Its fine.
- I would like to know more about you.

00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:50.016
There's not really much to know about me.

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:55.738
You said you're in English literature? Tell
me was it Charlotte Brontë, Jane Austen

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.574
or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love
with literature?

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:02.407
Hardy.

00:09:05.084 --> 00:09:06.711
I would've guessed Jane Austen.

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.394
What are your plans for after you graduate?

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:13.591
I'm just trying to get through my finals.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.454
- And then?
- Then I was planning on moving here

00:09:17.643 --> 00:09:19.658
to Seattle with Kate.

00:09:19.847 --> 00:09:22.085
We offer an excellent internship program

00:09:24.854 --> 00:09:26.961
I don't think I'd fit in here.

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:36.494
- Look at me.
- I am.

00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:42.359
<i>Mr Grey's office</i>

00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:43.995
I hope you got everything you needed

00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:47.178
I think you only answered four questions.

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:57.430
- Anastasia.
- Christian.

00:10:07.727 --> 00:10:09.050
Holy cow.

00:10:26.822 --> 00:10:29.498
- Before you say anything-
- You're a goddess, this is perfect.

00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:30.312
What?

00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:32.936
I just got his email, he
answered every question.

00:10:34.197 --> 00:10:36.265
So? What was he like?

00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:45.366
- He was fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:54.599
He was very polite, and courteous,
very formal and clean.

00:10:59.572 --> 00:11:00.886
Clean?

00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:06.403
I mean, he was you know, smart.

00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:11.156
And intense, kind of intimidating.

00:11:12.983 --> 00:11:15.726
- I can understand the fascination.
- Uh huh!

00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:20.639
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:22.025
Okay.

00:11:24.243 --> 00:11:25.923
I'm gonna make a sandwich, you want one?

00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:26.957
No, thanks.

00:11:32.838 --> 00:11:35.149
You have to admit, he's ridiculously hot.

00:11:35.338 --> 00:11:43.338
I'm sure if you're attracted
to that sort of human.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.850
The hot type of human?

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:51.229
I asked him if he was gay.
It was in your questions.

00:11:51.383 --> 00:11:52.383
Why would you do that to me?

00:11:52.405 --> 00:11:54.896
Because whenever he's in the society pages.

00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:57.289
He's never been photographed with a woman
So naturally.

00:11:57.478 --> 00:11:59.958
Well maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private Kate.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.541
- And now you're defending him.
- I'm ending this conversation.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.831
Too bad we don't have any
original photos of your

00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:11.371
hot, clean, 27 year old billionaire.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.923
The camera loves him as much as you do.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.193
Okay I wasn't hungry, but now I am.

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:22.091
Thank you.

00:13:04.568 --> 00:13:07.258
- Ana, I've been looking for you.
- Whats up?

00:13:07.447 --> 00:13:08.577
- Guess what?
- What?

00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:12.506
Portland's place is going to exhibit
my photographs next month.

00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:13.695
Oh my god!

00:13:14.282 --> 00:13:17.322
Congratulations, that's so good!

00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:19.849
- It feels so good.
- Can we celebrate later?

00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:22.684
- Cause I'm really late for work.
- Yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it.

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:27.797
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Thank you, you're my hero.

00:13:27.986 --> 00:13:29.928
- See you later.
- Okay.

00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:40.009
Mom I'm at work can I call you back?

00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:41.873
<i>No wait I called for a reason.</i>

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:45.241
<i>Bob broke his foot playing
golf of all things.</i>

00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:47.399
Christ is he okay? In a lot of pain?

00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:50.019
Who knows? The man called the paramedics
because of a blister.

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:53.999
<i>It means though, we won't
be able to fly in for graduation.</i>

00:13:55.549 --> 00:14:00.821
Really? You could just come alone,
you don't have to bring Bob.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.368
Least I could do to fend for himself.

00:14:03.757 --> 00:14:07.606
- You understand don't you darling?
- Yeah, yeah its fine.

00:14:09.263 --> 00:14:11.804
- I really have to go, okay?
- I love you Ana.

00:14:11.993 --> 00:14:13.419
I know I love you too.

00:14:14.615 --> 00:14:15.698
God.

00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:21.226
- Ana - can you give me a hand out back?
- Uh yeah yeah, I'll be right there.

00:14:31.722 --> 00:14:33.846
- Thought it was you.
- What the fuck?

00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:36.229
What a pleasant surprise Miss Steele.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:41.600
It's Ana, just Ana. You're in here...

00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:45.449
I was in the area on business,
needed to pick up a few things.

00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:51.165
- Are you free?
- Yeah… What can I help you with?

00:14:51.654 --> 00:14:53.197
Do you stock cable ties?

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:57.886
Cable ties, yes we do, I can
show you if you want.

00:14:58.475 --> 00:15:01.873
- Please, lead the way Miss Steele.
- Its Ana.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.873
- That it?
- Masking tape.

00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:13.217
- Are you redecorating?
- No.

00:15:14.812 --> 00:15:20.031
We have one inch and two
inch, but the truly self

00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:22.695
respecting handyman would
have both in his tool box.

00:15:23.184 --> 00:15:24.322
Of course he will.

00:15:24.511 --> 00:15:26.831
It's rare to find a
connoisseur these days...

00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:33.577
- Did you want anything else?
- Yes, rope.

00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:40.340
That's very impressive.
Do you girl scouts?

00:15:43.373 --> 00:15:47.417
No, organized activity groups aren't
really my thing.

00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:53.675
- So what is your thing?
- I don't know… Books?

00:15:56.021 --> 00:16:03.048
Okay, rope, tape, cable ties
You're like a complete serial killer.

00:16:03.637 --> 00:16:06.760
- Not today.
- Anything else?

00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:11.137
- What would you recommend?
- For a do-it-yourself er?

00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:15.204
Maybe coveralls, to
protect all your clothes?

00:16:16.335 --> 00:16:22.002
- Or I could just take all my clothes off.
- Okay, no clothes

00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:27.791
I mean, no coveralls
I can't think of anything else.

00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:32.275
- I guess that must be it.
- Cool.

00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:36.549
Thank you for answering
Kate's questions by the way.

00:16:36.638 --> 00:16:38.725
- She was thrilled.
- I hope she's feeling better.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.783
Yeah she is, she's just having trouble
finding an original photo of you.

00:16:42.818 --> 00:16:45.033
If she'd like an original,
I'm around tomorrow.

00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:48.476
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Yeah.

00:16:48.665 --> 00:16:52.505
- Do you want me to bag for you Ana?
- No, I'm good, thanks though Paul.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.789
Okay.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.481
I'm staying at the Heathman.
Call me before 10.

00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:11.180
- About the photos.
- Oh, yeah, I will.

00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:15.288
Enjoy your...

00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:37.286
Thanks for doing this again Mr Grey.

00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:41.463
- I'm happy to help.
- How about we try a few with a smile?

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:47.813
Or not.

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:50.779
You do realise he hasn't
stopped looking at you?

00:17:52.507 --> 00:17:55.239
He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.

00:17:55.428 --> 00:17:56.428
What?

00:17:57.512 --> 00:17:58.538
Kate shh…

00:18:00.171 --> 00:18:01.671
Is he your boyfriend?

00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.768
- Who?
- The photographer.

00:18:05.982 --> 00:18:10.540
- Jose? No.
- I've seen the way he was smiling at you.

00:18:12.071 --> 00:18:15.154
No Jose is more like family. He's
not my boyfriend.

00:18:15.543 --> 00:18:20.537
- And the guy at the store?
- Paul? No.

00:18:28.722 --> 00:18:29.972
Thank you.

00:18:38.797 --> 00:18:42.699
- You seem nervous.
- I find you intimidating.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.328
You should.

00:18:47.715 --> 00:18:50.901
- Eat.
- Not to mention high-handed.

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:54.383
I'm used to getting my own way.

00:18:54.418 --> 00:18:55.725
Then you must get very boring.

00:18:59.642 --> 00:19:03.788
- Tell me about your family.
- My family? Okay.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.645
My dad died when I was a baby.

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:09.316
So I was raised by my step-father Ray.

00:19:10.577 --> 00:19:13.308
- He's amazing.
- And your mom?

00:19:14.255 --> 00:19:22.124
My mother is on husband number four.
She's an incurable romantic.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.569
- And you?
- Am I romantic?

00:19:27.037 --> 00:19:31.155
Well I study English Literature.
I kind of have to be.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.960
But the photo shoot went well right?
Kate seems to be really happy.

00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:41.270
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- What?

00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:42.703
I'll walk you out.

00:19:48.682 --> 00:19:52.016
- Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
- I don't do the girlfriend thing.

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:54.205
- What does that even mean?
- Watch it!

00:20:06.725 --> 00:20:11.372
I'm not the man for you.
You should steer clear of me.

00:20:14.369 --> 00:20:15.958
I have to let you go.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.648
Goodbye Mr Grey.

00:20:27.375 --> 00:20:28.681
Alright pencils down.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.535
Please take your final exams to the
back of the classroom.

00:20:32.324 --> 00:20:34.805
Final grades will be posted
in two weeks.

00:20:34.994 --> 00:20:39.570
- Hey, you all good?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:43.100
- We are so partying tonight.
- Oh my god.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.068
This is way too much.

00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:47.932
No, we're getting exactly the
right amount.

00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:50.239
- All over my face?
- That's the idea.

00:20:51.744 --> 00:20:55.060
- Wow, no Kate.
- Cab's early, lets go.

00:20:57.492 --> 00:20:59.424
Ana, there's a package for you.

00:21:01.603 --> 00:21:05.742
<i>"Why didn't you tell me there was danger?
Why didn't you warn me?</i>

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.168
<i>"Ladies know what to guard against</i>

00:21:08.357 --> 00:21:10.917
<i>"... because they read novels
that tells them of these tricks ".</i>

00:21:10.948 --> 00:21:13.145
That's a quote from Tess
of the d'Urberville.

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.443
Oh my god.

00:21:15.478 --> 00:21:17.241
These must be from Christian.

00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:21.464
I mean…

00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:24.521
These are incredible.

00:21:25.221 --> 00:21:26.316
Wow, Grey.

00:21:27.533 --> 00:21:33.423
Kate these are first editions
I can't, this is too much.

00:21:34.484 --> 00:21:36.520
I can't accept them, I
have to send them back.

00:21:37.522 --> 00:21:40.266
That's the cab, okay, are you ready?

00:21:41.388 --> 00:21:43.463
- Are you really though?
- Yes, yes, very.

00:21:43.498 --> 00:21:44.660
Lets get outta here.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.246
Shots! Shots! Shots!

00:21:49.536 --> 00:21:51.218
No holding back here girl.

00:21:53.543 --> 00:21:55.658
- Did you do it all?
- Alright!

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:58.931
With my right eye closed and left handed,
I can get this in.

00:21:58.966 --> 00:21:59.966
- What?
- I gotta pee.

00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:01.432
- Okay.
- One, two...

00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:03.616
- Where you going?
- I gotta go pee.

00:22:42.217 --> 00:22:44.805
- Anastasia.
- Yep, this is me.

00:22:45.608 --> 00:22:49.686
Sending back your expensive books, cause
I already have hard copies of that,

00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:52.342
Thanks though, for the kind gesture.

00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:55.136
You're welcome. Where are you?

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.811
Oh… I'm in line, cause I have
to pee really bad.

00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:05.070
- Anastasia have you been drinking?
- Yeah, I have… Mr Fancy Pants.

00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:07.620
You hit the nail on the head.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.751
<i>I mean the head right on the nail.</i>

00:23:09.775 --> 00:23:12.788
Listen to me, I want you to
go home right now.

00:23:12.823 --> 00:23:13.906
<i>You're so bossy.</i>

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.452
"Ana, lets go for coffee"
"Ana, lets go for coffee."

00:23:18.476 --> 00:23:23.064
"No stay away from me Ana, I don't
want you. Get away."

00:23:23.088 --> 00:23:25.349
"Come here, come here."
"Go away."

00:23:25.428 --> 00:23:26.169
That's it.

00:23:26.193 --> 00:23:29.500
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm a long way from Seattle.

00:23:29.524 --> 00:23:32.533
- Long way from you.
- Which bar, whats it called?

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:35.048
- I don't know, I gotta go.
- Which bar Ana?

00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:40.756
I told him right?

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.522
I'm sorry I didn't mean...

00:23:50.547 --> 00:23:51.891
Stay where you are,
I'm coming to get you.

00:23:51.915 --> 00:23:56.033
What? Hello?

00:24:10.232 --> 00:24:13.801
- Hey.
- Oh thanks.

00:24:14.225 --> 00:24:15.518
Are you okay?

00:24:16.758 --> 00:24:21.636
Yes, I just feel a little
more drunk than...

00:24:22.514 --> 00:24:27.025
- Come here stay warm.
- Oh that's cool, I'm good Jose.

00:24:27.913 --> 00:24:31.646
No, I wanna have the courage
to do this.

00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:32.732
Do what?

00:24:32.756 --> 00:24:35.707
- Ana, I like you.
- You do?

00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:37.291
- Very much.
- Oh my god.

00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:41.216
- No, no, no.
- Please, one kiss.

00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:45.621
No, no, no José, I'm sorry, no.

00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:49.119
- Dude, she said no.
- Christian?

00:24:53.999 --> 00:24:55.595
- Don't look at me.
- Here.

00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:04.699
Nice touch, I will launder this item.

00:25:05.023 --> 00:25:07.110
- Lets get you home.
- I'm with kate.

00:25:07.334 --> 00:25:10.414
- I'll have Elliot tell her.
- Who's Elliot?

00:25:10.438 --> 00:25:12.719
He's my brother, he's inside
talking to her right now.

00:25:12.943 --> 00:25:15.859
- I, I don't...
- He's at my hotel with me.

00:25:16.083 --> 00:25:21.840
- You're still at the Heathman?
- Yes. Come.

00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:40.825
- That's your brother?
- Not by choice, lets go.

00:25:40.849 --> 00:25:42.600
Wait what did Kate say?

00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:45.365
She warned me to be on my best behaviour.

00:25:45.689 --> 00:25:48.155
- More like threatened me.
- She threatened you?

00:25:52.535 --> 00:25:56.081
You're spinning.
I think I'm gonna faint.

00:25:56.105 --> 00:25:57.114
What now?

00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:32.024
<i>Eat me, drink me.</i>

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:51.231
Good morning Anastasia.

00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:59.561
- How you feeling?
- Better than I deserve.

00:27:05.478 --> 00:27:07.059
Did you put me to bed?

00:27:11.467 --> 00:27:14.929
- You undressed me?
- I didn't have much choice.

00:27:16.306 --> 00:27:17.565
Where did you sleep?

00:27:22.749 --> 00:27:26.752
- Dear god… We didn't...
- Necrophillia's not my thing.

00:27:27.777 --> 00:27:31.761
- So we just slept then?
- It was a novelty for me too.

00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:40.570
You - need to eat.
I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.

00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:43.457
- Who's Taylor?
- My driver.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.769
- Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.
- Yes I did.

00:27:48.093 --> 00:27:49.725
Yours were covered in vomit.

00:27:52.408 --> 00:27:53.952
You shouldn't have drunk like that.

00:27:53.987 --> 00:27:55.828
I'm all for testing the limits but

00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:59.312
- ...you put yourself at risk last night.
- I know.

00:28:04.008 --> 00:28:06.424
If you were mine you wouldn't
be able to sit down for a week.

00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:08.462
What?

00:28:11.903 --> 00:28:13.442
I gotta go take a shower.

00:28:21.371 --> 00:28:23.238
Why am I here Christian?

00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.921
You're here because I'm incapable
of leaving you alone.

00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:34.289
Then don't.

00:28:39.462 --> 00:28:43.927
- Why'd you send me those books?
- I thought I owed you an apology.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.807
- For what?
- For letting you believe that I...

00:28:53.718 --> 00:28:59.044
Listen to me. I don't do romance.

00:29:02.682 --> 00:29:09.113
My tastes are very - singular.
You wouldn't understand.

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:19.036
Enlighten me then.

00:29:56.321 --> 00:30:01.230
- You look beautiful.
- Taylor has good taste.

00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:09.244
- What are you doing here later?
- I'm working at the hardware store till 7.

00:30:09.865 --> 00:30:11.615
I'll have Taylor pick you up then.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.568
I'd like to bite that lip.

00:30:20.687 --> 00:30:22.426
I think I'd like that.

00:30:23.624 --> 00:30:27.193
I'm not gonna touch you, not
until I have your written consent.

00:30:28.298 --> 00:30:29.416
What?

00:30:29.843 --> 00:30:32.510
I'll explain later.
Come I'll take you home.

00:30:45.862 --> 00:30:47.583
Fuck the paperwork.

00:31:11.373 --> 00:31:13.243
What is it about elevators?

00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:25.551
Hey.

00:31:27.258 --> 00:31:30.774
- Hi, you must be Ana.
- You must be Elliot.

00:31:30.798 --> 00:31:32.452
And we must be going, Elliot.

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:36.393
So awesome your place.
Kate's told me a lot about you.

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:39.482
Elliot grab your shoes, some of us
have work to return to.

00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:42.718
What you're doing with Mr. Worm here,
I've got no idea.

00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:47.154
Laters baby.

00:31:50.507 --> 00:31:53.228
I'll see you tonight, email
me if something changes.

00:31:53.418 --> 00:31:54.804
My computer's broken.

00:31:54.839 --> 00:31:57.427
Well call then, you know
you have my number.

00:31:59.239 --> 00:32:00.600
Laters baby.

00:32:06.602 --> 00:32:10.442
- Elliot seems really nice.
- No, no. We're starting with you.

00:32:10.666 --> 00:32:13.790
If you're seeing him again tonight,
this means that something happened.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.016
- Ana? Tell me what happened...
- I have to get ready for work.

00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:24.192
We just kissed. Once.

00:32:24.816 --> 00:32:27.665
Only once? That's odd.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.360
- Odd doesn't even cover it.
- Uh huh, and a new jacket.

00:32:50.158 --> 00:32:51.158
Bye.

00:32:52.565 --> 00:32:54.993
Hi, its Taylor right?

00:32:55.017 --> 00:32:58.406
Good evening Miss Steele, Mr
Grey will be joining us there.

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:15.261
Good evening, Anastasia.

00:33:31.368 --> 00:33:32.988
What, you're flying this?

00:33:50.551 --> 00:33:51.974
No escaping now.

00:33:57.588 --> 00:34:00.983
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango.
Ready to depart.

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:03.665
<i>Charlie tango, your flight plan to
Seattle has been cleared..</i>

00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:06.335
Seattle? That's where we're going?

00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:11.983
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes please.

00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:42.143
- You play?
- Yes.

00:35:44.946 --> 00:35:46.571
Of course you do.

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:58.293
- Whats this?
- Its a nondisclosure agreement.

00:35:59.538 --> 00:36:03.553
It means you cannot discuss anything
about us with anyone.

00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:06.862
I'm afraid my lawyer insists on it.

00:36:06.897 --> 00:36:09.501
I would never talk to anyone
about us anyway.

00:36:21.405 --> 00:36:23.488
Are you gonna make love to me now?

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.930
Two things: First, I don't make love

00:36:34.389 --> 00:36:37.006
I fuck - hard.

00:36:40.103 --> 00:36:45.915
- And the second?
- Come.

00:36:59.407 --> 00:37:02.731
- Its just around this door.
- What is it?

00:37:02.955 --> 00:37:06.806
- My playroom.
- Like your xbox and stuff?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.769
Its important you know that you
can leave at any time.

00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:12.162
Why, whats in there?

00:37:13.703 --> 00:37:15.670
I meant what I said, the helicopter

00:37:15.705 --> 00:37:17.637
is not standby, for whenever you
wanna go.

00:37:17.866 --> 00:37:19.450
Just open the door.

00:37:37.399 --> 00:37:38.739
Oh my god.

00:38:18.676 --> 00:38:20.036
Its called a flogger.

00:38:30.699 --> 00:38:32.448
Say something please.

00:38:38.802 --> 00:38:40.519
Do women do this to you or...

00:38:40.543 --> 00:38:43.232
I do this to women. With women.

00:38:43.581 --> 00:38:44.942
Women who want me to.

00:38:55.778 --> 00:38:59.266
- You're a sadist?
- I'm a dominant.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:00.646
What does that mean?

00:39:00.681 --> 00:39:03.525
It means I want you to willingly
surrender yourself to me.

00:39:04.582 --> 00:39:06.166
Why would I do that?

00:39:07.153 --> 00:39:12.011
- To please me.
- Please you? How?

00:39:12.035 --> 00:39:16.192
I have rules, if you follow them,
I'll reward you.

00:39:16.516 --> 00:39:18.942
If you don't, I'll punish you.

00:39:18.966 --> 00:39:22.563
You'd punish me, you'd
use this stuff on me?

00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:27.957
- Yes.
- What would I get out of this?

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.170
Me.

00:39:46.057 --> 00:39:50.543
If we were to do this,
this would be your room.

00:39:50.967 --> 00:39:52.692
You can decorate it however you like.

00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:57.072
You want me to move in?

00:39:57.496 --> 00:40:00.191
Not full time, just
Friday through to Sunday.

00:40:00.415 --> 00:40:07.467
- We can negotiate the particulars.
- So - I'd sleep in here with you?

00:40:07.791 --> 00:40:12.453
No I sleep downstairs. I told you
I don't sleep with anyone.

00:40:14.377 --> 00:40:17.464
What if I don't want anything to
do with that?

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:19.337
Then I understand completely.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.658
But then we wouldn't have
any sort of relationship at all?

00:40:22.782 --> 00:40:25.350
This is the only sort of
relationship I have.

00:40:26.855 --> 00:40:32.565
- Why?
- Its the way I am.

00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:44.853
When you said negotiate, what did you mean?

00:40:44.877 --> 00:40:48.576
I already have the contract prepared.
Fairly detailed.

00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:54.637
You would review, and negotiate what
you are and not willing to try.

00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:57.118
How can I know what I'd
be willing to try?

00:40:57.779 --> 00:41:02.043
Well when you had sex, was there
anything you didn't like doing?

00:41:04.997 --> 00:41:07.407
We have to be honest with each other
for this to work,

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:08.431
Okay?

00:41:11.378 --> 00:41:17.789
- I… I wouldn't know.
- What do you mean?

00:41:21.173 --> 00:41:25.823
- Because I haven't...
- You're still a virgin?

00:41:27.034 --> 00:41:29.949
- I've just shown you-
- I know, I know.

00:41:30.373 --> 00:41:34.204
- You've done other things right?
- No.

00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:47.232
- Where have you been?
- Waiting.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.635
Guys must throw themselves at you.

00:41:53.078 --> 00:41:54.886
They're never what I've wanted.

00:42:00.691 --> 00:42:02.237
Your biting your lip.

00:42:14.474 --> 00:42:17.748
- What are you doing?
- Rectifying the situation.

00:42:17.872 --> 00:42:19.290
I'm a situation?

00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:16.883
You're energetic this morning.

00:47:18.707 --> 00:47:21.576
- You hungry?
- Very.

00:47:25.613 --> 00:47:27.313
Because I'm making pancakes.

00:47:35.011 --> 00:47:36.740
Lets get you cleaned up.

00:48:26.866 --> 00:48:28.371
Do you trust me?

00:48:40.436 --> 00:48:41.701
Stay here.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.779
Hold out your wrists.

00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:19.895
Hold them there. Understand?

00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:26.629
- Tell me you understand.
- I won't move my arms.

00:49:27.653 --> 00:49:28.751
Good girl.

00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:41.181
- Stay still.
- Okay.

00:49:50.857 --> 00:49:53.959
- Say yes.
- To what.

00:49:53.983 --> 00:49:55.586
Being mine.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.922
<i>Christian!</i>

00:50:01.946 --> 00:50:04.397
- Shit.
- Its my mother.

00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:10.201
- I'm naked.
- Get dressed.

00:50:12.414 --> 00:50:17.019
No need to show me around, no
need to hover.

00:50:17.043 --> 00:50:20.541
- He's sleeping Dr. Grey.
- Still sleeping? He never sleeps in.

00:50:20.576 --> 00:50:21.998
Certainly not at this hour.

00:50:22.022 --> 00:50:23.642
Unless of course he's ill is he? Ah.

00:50:23.966 --> 00:50:27.119
- Sorry Mr. Grey.
- Its fine I know how she can be.

00:50:27.143 --> 00:50:31.878
She? Darling you can try to avoid me, but
the least you can do is.

00:50:31.913 --> 00:50:34.183
Call me by my correct name, which is mama.

00:50:34.607 --> 00:50:37.734
- Hi.
- Oh, dear god.

00:50:37.769 --> 00:50:40.445
Mother, Anastasia Steele.
Ana, meet my mother.

00:50:40.469 --> 00:50:42.036
Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.571
You have no idea how
delighted I am to meet you.

00:50:45.595 --> 00:50:47.773
Its nice to meet you too Dr. Grey.

00:50:47.797 --> 00:50:50.304
Grace. She's very pretty.

00:50:50.339 --> 00:50:51.582
You are very pretty.

00:50:51.606 --> 00:50:52.606
Thanks.

00:50:53.613 --> 00:50:55.802
What happened to calling before
dropping by?

00:50:56.226 --> 00:50:59.273
And have your head-henchman give
me the run around here, no thank you.

00:50:59.297 --> 00:51:03.245
I'll take my chances. Well I was in the
neighbourhood and I thought perhaps

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:04.607
we could have lunch.

00:51:04.631 --> 00:51:06.897
I can't today, I have to drive Ana home.

00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:11.537
Its okay, take it.
I was just showing mother out.

00:51:11.572 --> 00:51:12.572
Excuse me.

00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:15.234
Anastasia!

00:51:15.258 --> 00:51:16.884
- Kate, wait.
- It was a joy to meet you.

00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:20.248
I'm having the whole family
for dinner at my house.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.885
Christian's sister Mia is back
from Paris, so lets come.

00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:25.331
We'll see mother.

00:51:25.355 --> 00:51:27.546
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:30.686
Kate.

00:51:31.714 --> 00:51:32.987
Thank you.

00:51:38.134 --> 00:51:40.278
I can't talk about it right now Kate.

00:51:45.459 --> 00:51:47.626
I gotta go, I'll call you back okay?

00:52:06.048 --> 00:52:07.856
Everything okay with the phone call?

00:52:10.059 --> 00:52:13.638
Yeah, nothing important.
I liked your mom.

00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:17.927
She's excited. She's never seen
me with a woman before.

00:52:18.551 --> 00:52:20.144
You're the first.

00:52:25.729 --> 00:52:27.267
What is it Ana?

00:52:29.161 --> 00:52:33.277
I just… How many women have stayed in here?

00:52:35.191 --> 00:52:36.449
15.

00:52:38.695 --> 00:52:42.761
- That's a lot of women.
- I told you before, if you want out-

00:52:42.785 --> 00:52:46.213
I don't want out, I'm just not jumping
at the opportunity

00:52:46.237 --> 00:52:48.949
for whips, torture and your red room
of pain.

00:52:48.973 --> 00:52:52.274
The red room is much more about pleasure.
I promise you.

00:52:56.566 --> 00:52:59.826
Will we still go out to
dinner, and movies...

00:53:00.999 --> 00:53:02.662
That's not really my thing.

00:53:05.004 --> 00:53:06.569
Try to keep an open mind.

00:53:10.197 --> 00:53:14.268
If you agree to be my submissive,
I will be devoted to you.

00:53:16.494 --> 00:53:20.166
This is what I want.
And I want it with you.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.383
Why do I have to sleep in here?
We slept in the same bed last night.

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.149
Like normal people.

00:53:32.573 --> 00:53:35.601
Try not to get hung up on the
sleeping arrangements.

00:53:36.376 --> 00:53:39.257
If you agree to do this,
you're gonna want your own room.

00:53:39.581 --> 00:53:41.748
Why, because I'll be your sex slave?

00:53:42.357 --> 00:53:45.362
I don't wanna do this here,
lets talk downstairs.

00:53:45.386 --> 00:53:49.384
No. I think I'll hold on to my
freewill a little while longer thank you.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.127
Actually you know what, I would like
to go home, can I go home?

00:54:00.269 --> 00:54:03.348
- Which one's yours?
- All of them.

00:54:53.643 --> 00:54:55.272
Lets go for a walk.

00:54:58.025 --> 00:55:03.083
- How did you start doing this?
- One of my mother's friends.

00:55:04.751 --> 00:55:08.330
- I was 15.
- She seduced you?

00:55:08.854 --> 00:55:15.780
- I was her submissive for six years.
- Seriously, does your mother know that?

00:55:15.804 --> 00:55:20.342
Of course not. No one in my family
knows about this.

00:55:21.066 --> 00:55:22.555
Part of me.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.837
So she introduced you to all of this?
Mrs Robinson?

00:55:30.642 --> 00:55:34.905
Mrs Robinson? I'll tell her you said that.
She'll love it.

00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:41.595
- You still talk to her?
- On occasions. We're friends.

00:55:46.792 --> 00:55:54.598
Ana. I know how intimidating this is.
I felt the same at first.

00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:59.233
Well… What made you change your mind?

00:56:02.224 --> 00:56:08.335
By giving up control, I felt free,
from responsibilities.

00:56:08.359 --> 00:56:12.388
From making decisions.
I felt safe.

00:56:13.363 --> 00:56:15.207
You will too, you'll see.

00:56:18.013 --> 00:56:20.950
I never took anyone in the helicopter.

00:56:22.191 --> 00:56:27.229
Never had sex in my own bed.
Never slept with anyone.

00:56:27.553 --> 00:56:31.514
Ever. Only you.

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:58.749
This is the contract.
Read it carefully.

00:56:59.073 --> 00:57:01.193
Email me if you have any questions.

00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:03.603
I told you, my computer's down.

00:57:03.627 --> 00:57:05.051
Just consider it okay?

00:57:10.951 --> 00:57:12.605
I really hope you say yes.

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:26.357
- Thanks for the ride.
- Laters baby.

00:57:31.669 --> 00:57:33.880
- Um.
- Okay, you're all set.

00:57:34.004 --> 00:57:34.995
Your roommate let me in.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.462
I just figured you
forgot to tell me about it.

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:39.469
- Do I look okay?
- Tell you about what?

00:57:39.504 --> 00:57:42.174
- Just sign here.
- Hold on, do you have the right apartment?

00:57:42.198 --> 00:57:43.856
Anastasia Steele?

00:57:50.932 --> 00:57:53.391
- Enjoy.
- Another gift huh?

00:57:53.415 --> 00:57:55.935
What happened to flowers and chocolate?

00:57:55.959 --> 00:57:57.887
I'm dying to hear everything, but

00:57:57.922 --> 00:58:00.069
I have to run right now, cause Elliot
and I are having dinner.

00:58:00.093 --> 00:58:01.606
And then we're seeing a show at the Gorge.

00:58:01.665 --> 00:58:04.653
Jose called for you, twice, by the way.

00:58:04.877 --> 00:58:09.119
- Is that some article?
- No... These are.

00:58:09.143 --> 00:58:11.463
These are my thesis notes, I
left them at school.

00:58:11.853 --> 00:58:13.694
Oh okay, well there's yesterday's mail.

00:58:23.058 --> 00:58:27.870
- What?
- I don't know. You look - different.

00:58:28.647 --> 00:58:32.068
- I feel different.
- Of course you do.

00:58:34.008 --> 00:58:36.465
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:37.654
Bye.

00:59:24.558 --> 00:59:27.240
<i>The following are the terms of
a binding contract. .</i>

00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:32.765
<i>Between the dominant and the submissive.
The fundamental purpose of this contract.</i>

00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:36.954
<i>Is to allow the submissive to explore her
sensuality, and her limits of safeness.</i>

00:59:38.227 --> 00:59:41.976
<i>The dominant and the submissive agree and
acknowledge that all that occurs</i>

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.601
<i>under the terms of this contract will
be consensual, confidential.</i>

00:59:45.725 --> 00:59:49.190
<i>And subject to the agreed limits
and safety procedures.</i>

00:59:49.214 --> 00:59:54.687
<i>Set out in this contract.
The submissive will agree to any...</i>

00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:57.779
<i>sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable
by the dominant,</i>

00:59:57.803 --> 01:00:00.740
<i>Excepting those activities,
outlined in HARD LIMITS.</i>

01:00:03.637 --> 01:00:07.597
<i>The submissive agrees to procure
oral contraception from a physician</i>

01:00:07.621 --> 01:00:12.315
<i>of the dominant's choosing.
The submissive will not enter into</i>

01:00:12.339 --> 01:00:15.412
<i>sexual relations with anyone other
than the dominant.</i>

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:21.254
<i>The submissive will eat regularly,
to maintain her health and well-being</i>

01:00:21.278 --> 01:00:22.852
<i>from a prescribed list of foods.</i>

01:00:25.064 --> 01:00:27.345
<i>The submissive will not drink to excess</i>

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.507
<i>smoke or take recreational drugs.</i>

01:00:31.744 --> 01:00:35.623
<i>The submissive will conduct herself
in a respectful manner.</i>

01:00:35.647 --> 01:00:39.534
<i>To the dominant, and so only address him
as Sir, Mr Grey.</i>

01:00:39.558 --> 01:00:41.567
<i>Or such other title, the
dominant may direct.</i>

01:00:43.403 --> 01:00:47.071
<i>The submissive may not touch the dominant,
without his expressed permission to do so.</i>

01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:51.014
<i>The safe word yellow</i>

01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:53.110
<i>will be used to bring the attention
of the dominant</i>

01:00:53.134 --> 01:00:55.534
<i>that the submissive is close to her limit.</i>

01:00:55.558 --> 01:00:57.331
<i>When the safe word RED is spoken.</i>

01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:59.348
<i>The dominantes actions will cease
completely</i>

01:00:59.372 --> 01:01:01.132
<i>and immediately.</i>

01:01:01.167 --> 01:01:02.910
<i>Submissive.</i>

01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:08.981
<i>Does the submissive agree to be
restrained, with hands bound?</i>

01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:11.797
<i>Does the submissive consent
to being blindfolded?</i>

01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:14.694
<i>Does the submissive consent to be gagged?</i>

01:01:14.718 --> 01:01:18.294
<i>How much pain is the submissive
willing to experience?</i>

01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:57.647
Christian.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:01.116
Its been nice knowing me has it?

01:02:14.374 --> 01:02:17.953
Let me remind you, how nice it was.

01:02:25.924 --> 01:02:27.404
Is this what you want?

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:56.693
Don't make a sound.

01:04:53.528 --> 01:04:54.808
That was really nice.

01:05:03.126 --> 01:05:04.712
What are you doing to me?

01:05:23.175 --> 01:05:24.629
What about here?

01:05:27.498 --> 01:05:30.876
Why not? Is that breaking the rules?

01:05:34.729 --> 01:05:38.819
- Speaking of which...
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.543
You're not staying?

01:05:49.004 --> 01:05:53.179
I told you.
I don't sleep with anyone.

01:05:54.332 --> 01:05:55.931
Can we negotiate?

01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:19.975
That's a hell of a sack Miss Steele.

01:07:29.509 --> 01:07:30.799
Business meeting.

01:07:56.867 --> 01:07:59.951
- Impressive.
- I've done this before.

01:08:02.909 --> 01:08:06.093
- Business meetings I mean.
- Oh.

01:08:06.717 --> 01:08:09.568
Miss Steele. Your meeting.

01:08:11.649 --> 01:08:15.819
Page 1 - strike out my old address
and replace it with the new one.

01:08:16.143 --> 01:08:18.269
An oversight. Do go on.

01:08:18.693 --> 01:08:21.330
Page 3, section 15-20.

01:08:21.754 --> 01:08:25.552
"The submissive shall submit to
any sexual activity"

01:08:25.576 --> 01:08:30.244
"... demanded by the dominant without
hesitation or argument."

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:41.567
Turn to page 5, appendix 3, soft limits.

01:08:42.339 --> 01:08:45.389
- With you.
- Find anal fisting.

01:08:45.713 --> 01:08:48.350
- I'm all ears.
- Strike it out.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.522
Strike out vaginal fisting too.

01:08:55.946 --> 01:08:58.181
- You sure?
- Yep.

01:09:00.387 --> 01:09:01.428
Same page.

01:09:01.452 --> 01:09:04.164
"Is the use of sex toys acceptable
to the submissive."

01:09:04.188 --> 01:09:07.038
Vibrators - okay Dildos - fine.

01:09:07.794 --> 01:09:11.117
Genital clamps - absolutely not.

01:09:11.441 --> 01:09:17.446
- Consider them gone.
- What are butt plugs?

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:35.995
You must go through quite a few
non-disclosure agreements.

01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:39.301
My staff know only what I
choose to tell them.

01:09:40.032 --> 01:09:41.985
Please resume Miss Steele.

01:09:45.164 --> 01:09:48.928
Also, on page 5, there are some terms
which need clarification.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:53.876
- Suspension.
- Hanging on a rope from the ceiling.

01:09:54.907 --> 01:09:58.075
- For what possible reason?
- For your pleasure.

01:09:58.673 --> 01:10:03.414
- Really?
- And mine - something to consider.

01:10:03.438 --> 01:10:04.962
No. Hard limit.

01:10:07.081 --> 01:10:11.737
"Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?"
I'm good with rope.

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:16.412
Leather casts, hand cuffs...
Please lose tape.

01:10:18.139 --> 01:10:23.714
- And whats others?
- Cable ties?

01:10:26.877 --> 01:10:30.633
Can I just say how impressed I am
with your commitment to this meeting?

01:10:32.105 --> 01:10:36.113
And in that spirit, I'm gonna offer
something sweeter.

01:10:37.095 --> 01:10:42.427
How about, once a week, on a night
of your choosing, we go on a date.

01:10:43.613 --> 01:10:50.518
Just like a regular couple - dinner
movie, ice skating.

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:55.635
- Whatever you want.
- Accepted.

01:10:56.435 --> 01:11:01.030
- You're very kind.
- I'll suggest it in Appendix 5.

01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:19.190
I would like to fuck you into
the middle of next week.

01:11:22.169 --> 01:11:26.023
- You're not fighting fair.
- I never have.

01:11:27.703 --> 01:11:32.419
I'll review all these changes and
try to arrive at a decision.

01:11:32.443 --> 01:11:35.534
- You wanna leave?
- Yes.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:41.056
But your body tells me something different.
Your legs for instance.

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:45.110
The way you're pressing your thighs
together under the table.

01:11:46.751 --> 01:11:52.257
The change in your breathing.
And then your complexion.

01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:55.291
- My complexion?
- You're flushed.

01:11:56.276 --> 01:11:59.239
- That could just be the wine.
- Its the adrenaline.

01:12:08.437 --> 01:12:13.628
Say I did stay. What would happen?

01:12:14.452 --> 01:12:19.214
First, I would help you out of
that little dress of yours.

01:12:20.232 --> 01:12:22.988
- Yes?
- Then I'd be pleased to discover

01:12:23.012 --> 01:12:26.018
- ...that you are naked underneath.
- Really?

01:12:28.507 --> 01:12:32.095
- Then I would bend you over.
- Right here?

01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:36.302
- Yes.
- On this table?

01:12:37.761 --> 01:12:38.761
Yes.

01:12:57.967 --> 01:12:59.802
Thank you for the meeting Mr. Grey.

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.128
This is me.

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:16.967
Didn't know I was a collector
of classic cars huh?

01:13:19.544 --> 01:13:22.248
You're sure I can't persuade
you to stay?

01:13:22.283 --> 01:13:23.819
Goodnight, Christian.

01:13:23.843 --> 01:13:27.874
- When will you know?
- Soon, maybe.

01:13:37.466 --> 01:13:39.584
Why do I think you're telling me goodbye?

01:13:41.009 --> 01:13:42.075
Because I'm leaving.

01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:51.378
You got your speech ready yet?

01:13:51.413 --> 01:13:52.413
More or less.

01:13:52.665 --> 01:13:54.437
- Annie.
- Dad!

01:13:56.555 --> 01:13:57.555
Hi.

01:13:57.647 --> 01:14:00.158
Sorry I'm late, I had a hell
of a time parking.

01:14:00.182 --> 01:14:02.331
Oh that's okay, you're here,
that's all that matters.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:03.810
You're kidding me, I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

01:14:03.834 --> 01:14:06.098
I saved you a seat next
to Kate's parents okay?

01:14:06.122 --> 01:14:07.615
- I'll sit where you want Miss Steele.
- Okay. I'll see you after.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:09.361
Yeah, good luck out there.

01:14:09.585 --> 01:14:12.642
And is also a major benefactor
for our university.

01:14:13.146 --> 01:14:16.717
Please join me in welcoming,
Mr Christian Grey.

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:37.135
Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great
compliment accorded to me today.

01:14:37.902 --> 01:14:42.169
- He is so hot.
- Oh god. He so is.

01:14:45.403 --> 01:14:46.641
I heard he's gay.

01:14:46.676 --> 01:14:49.317
<i>Sustainable methods of farming
for third world countries.</i>

01:14:49.917 --> 01:14:55.448
The goal? To eradicate hunger and poverty
across the globe.

01:14:59.408 --> 01:15:04.278
I myself have known what its
like to be profoundly hungry.

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.964
So this is a very personal mission for me.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:18.509
Anastasia Steele.

01:15:20.493 --> 01:15:21.493
Thanks.

01:15:25.286 --> 01:15:27.693
Congratulations, you must be very proud.

01:15:27.717 --> 01:15:32.319
- I am. Nice tie by the way?
- Truthfully its become my favourite.

01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:36.045
- Do you have your answer yet?
- I'm still thinking.

01:15:36.069 --> 01:15:38.967
Anastasia, just try it my way. Please.

01:15:39.895 --> 01:15:41.818
- Okay.
- What?

01:15:45.929 --> 01:15:47.421
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:54.527
- Dad hi!
- I am so proud of you Annie.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:55.583
Thank you.

01:15:55.607 --> 01:15:58.783
Oh, Kate. Best speech of all others.

01:15:58.941 --> 01:15:59.981
- Thanks.
- Of course.

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:01.141
Yeah, I agree.

01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:03.205
- Ana? Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:03.961 --> 01:16:06.282
Ray, have you met Christian Grey?
Ana's new boyfriend?

01:16:06.317 --> 01:16:07.317
Hi.

01:16:07.808 --> 01:16:08.987
Great pleasure to meet you.

01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:10.501
My pleasure. I really enjoyed your speech.

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:11.260
Thank you sir.

01:16:11.285 --> 01:16:13.466
Sounds like you've accomplished
some pretty impressive things.

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:14.379
And what things?

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.386
Thank you. - Okay, I'm gonna go find
my family, who are

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.231
impatiently waiting to embarrass me. Bye.

01:16:19.255 --> 01:16:22.237
- Visit us soon yeah?
- Soon as I get an invitation.

01:16:23.009 --> 01:16:24.622
So, how long you two known each other?

01:16:26.234 --> 01:16:28.674
A few weeks now, we actually met when
Anastasia

01:16:28.694 --> 01:16:30.845
interviewed me for the student newspaper.

01:16:30.869 --> 01:16:33.150
- A picture please Mr. Grey?
- One minute excuse me.

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:37.645
Big smile now.

01:16:47.481 --> 01:16:51.679
To celebrate your graduation.
Among other things.

01:16:55.271 --> 01:16:58.590
Roll your eyes at me again and
I will take you across my knee.

01:17:04.413 --> 01:17:05.664
So it begins.

01:17:09.822 --> 01:17:12.525
- Come on, I've got something to show you.
- What?

01:17:21.563 --> 01:17:25.934
That's cute. Doesn't really
seem like your style though.

01:17:26.358 --> 01:17:32.402
Its not, happy graduation Anastasia.

01:17:33.085 --> 01:17:36.455
Oh my god. Christian that's a car.

01:17:37.289 --> 01:17:38.509
You don't miss much do you?

01:17:41.566 --> 01:17:43.723
Thank you but I can't. This is too...

01:17:43.947 --> 01:17:46.744
- Do you like it?
- Of course I like it, its beautiful.

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:53.320
But I have a car...
Where's my car?

01:17:53.344 --> 01:17:55.499
I told Taylor to fetch
a decent price for it.

01:17:55.523 --> 01:17:57.467
Christian, this is way too much.

01:17:57.491 --> 01:17:59.057
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:10.492
- Do you know why I'm doing this?
- Because I rolled my eyes at you.

01:18:10.849 --> 01:18:12.059
And is that polite?

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:14.605
No.

01:18:14.714 --> 01:18:17.392
- Excuse me?
- No, sir.

01:18:36.424 --> 01:18:39.204
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Yes.

01:18:46.602 --> 01:18:48.243
Welcome to my world.

01:19:10.156 --> 01:19:13.594
- What are you doing?
- There a few things at the office

01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.945
which require my attention.

01:19:16.198 --> 01:19:17.545
You okay?

01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:23.810
- I just thought that...
- I enjoyed tonight.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.620
I'll see you at my place tomorrow.

01:19:58.705 --> 01:19:59.705
Hi mama.

01:19:59.729 --> 01:20:03.914
<i>Anastasia?, whats going on,
I've left you two messages this week.</i>

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:09.276
I know I'm sorry. I just
got a little distracted.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.654
<i>I'm sorry I missed your graduation honey
I heard it was lovely.</i>

01:20:13.085 --> 01:20:14.513
And your new beau.

01:20:15.032 --> 01:20:18.195
Ray told me all about him, he
sounds such a young man.

01:20:18.944 --> 01:20:22.229
<i>Of course, I would've preferred to
have heard about it from you.</i>

01:20:26.395 --> 01:20:27.482
Ana?

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.898
<i>Whats the matter?</i>

01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:32.896
Nothing I'm fine.

01:20:33.672 --> 01:20:35.363
Is he not making you happy?

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:39.625
He is yeah, I mean most of the time yeah.

01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:42.092
<i>Its complicated.</i>

01:20:44.643 --> 01:20:47.797
Listen honey, if you need a break,
you just

01:20:47.917 --> 01:20:50.528
come on right down here.

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.349
<i>Even if its just for a day or two.</i>

01:20:52.373 --> 01:20:55.217
<i>I have air miles, and we could talk
and have girl time.</i>

01:20:56.805 --> 01:21:02.617
- Promise me you'll think about it?
- Yeah I promise. I promise.

01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:07.197
- I love you mama.
- I love you too darling.

01:21:08.383 --> 01:21:11.715
I gotta go. Bye.

01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:22.345
<i>Looks like you and Grey did
some celebration last night.</i>

01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:27.782
- Is he still asleep?
- No, he couldn't stay.

01:21:28.506 --> 01:21:30.186
Well whose car keys are those then?

01:21:33.508 --> 01:21:37.184
- Those are my keys.
- Wow Ana.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.300
What?

01:21:40.324 --> 01:21:41.961
Nothing, I'm just...

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:45.088
Make sure you're taking
it at your own pace okay?

01:21:45.112 --> 01:21:47.529
I am, I am, I gotta go.

01:21:47.553 --> 01:21:48.899
Where are you going?

01:21:56.796 --> 01:22:01.595
- Look at this.
- I've seen it, not a bad picture.

01:22:02.358 --> 01:22:04.191
Christian Grey and friend.

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:06.646
So we're friends.

01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:09.422
Well it must be true,
if its in the paper.

01:22:11.028 --> 01:22:13.863
- So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
- It was fine.

01:22:13.987 --> 01:22:16.058
But she said I had to abstain from

01:22:16.093 --> 01:22:18.448
all sexual activity for four weeks.

01:22:18.472 --> 01:22:20.232
You know, after I start the pill.

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:21.243
What?

01:22:24.396 --> 01:22:25.396
Just kidding.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.651
I wanna take you to my playroom.

01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:51.198
- I haven't signed the contract.
- I'm well aware. Call it a free sample.

01:22:52.486 --> 01:22:53.581
Okay.

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:00.700
Ready?

01:23:35.459 --> 01:23:40.423
Eyes down. Take off your shoes.

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:46.068
Arms above your head.

01:23:52.044 --> 01:23:54.637
You have a beautiful body Anastasia.

01:24:00.163 --> 01:24:02.558
I want you unashamed of
your nakedness, understand?

01:24:04.487 --> 01:24:05.487
Yes sir.

01:24:07.467 --> 01:24:11.007
Stop biting your lip, you know what it does
to me. Turn around.

01:24:19.142 --> 01:24:23.157
When I tell you to come into this room
This is how you'll be.

01:24:25.108 --> 01:24:26.308
You'll wait for me.

01:24:27.758 --> 01:24:29.344
Kneeling by the door.

01:24:40.184 --> 01:24:44.873
Hands flat on your thighs.
Good.

01:25:17.159 --> 01:25:18.595
Hold out your hands.

01:25:45.434 --> 01:25:48.637
- Did that hurt?
- No.

01:25:48.925 --> 01:25:52.066
You see? Much of your fear is in your head.

01:25:53.753 --> 01:25:54.883
Come.

01:28:14.135 --> 01:28:17.542
- How does that feel?
- Good.

01:28:38.451 --> 01:28:39.605
Quiet.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:13.755
Where are we going?

01:30:18.808 --> 01:30:20.618
Remember my mother mentioned dinner?

01:30:21.413 --> 01:30:22.792
My sister Mia's in town.

01:30:23.589 --> 01:30:24.589
Yes.

01:30:28.153 --> 01:30:31.739
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

01:30:33.293 --> 01:30:34.352
Dance with me.

01:31:22.299 --> 01:31:23.942
Good evening Mr. Grey.

01:31:23.977 --> 01:31:24.977
They're here!

01:31:25.362 --> 01:31:26.362
You're here.

01:31:26.529 --> 01:31:29.485
- Welcome welcome.
- Ana, you've met my mother.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.439
Hi, lovely to see you.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.650
This is my father, Carrick.
Hi, its nice to meet you.

01:31:32.685 --> 01:31:33.636
Pleasure to meet you.

01:31:33.671 --> 01:31:34.201
<i>Is she here?</i>

01:31:34.236 --> 01:31:35.800
There's been a lot of speculation!

01:31:35.867 --> 01:31:37.933
Oh my god! She exists!

01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:41.997
Its a great apartment, and
the rent's not ridiculous

01:31:42.385 --> 01:31:44.219
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.

01:31:45.101 --> 01:31:49.208
Jose is Ana's friend, although I
think Elliot's trying to poach me.

01:31:49.243 --> 01:31:52.630
He's a cool guy!

01:31:53.632 --> 01:31:55.805
Ana, where is your family from?

01:31:56.113 --> 01:31:59.403
My step father's in Montesano and
my mom lives in Georgia.

01:31:59.467 --> 01:32:01.814
- Georgia? Which part?
- Savannah.

01:32:02.148 --> 01:32:06.987
How nice! Although I hear it gets really
humid in Georgia this time of year.

01:32:07.171 --> 01:32:10.495
Oh my god it does. Its stifling sometimes.

01:32:10.501 --> 01:32:12.427
Actually I'm going to visit her tomorrow.

01:32:12.601 --> 01:32:15.939
How nice. You hear that Christian?

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:19.124
Some children do visit their
parents now and again.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:24.623
- Hey dad you catch the Mariners game?
- I heard it went back stream.

01:32:27.322 --> 01:32:29.098
This is news to me. When
were you gonna tell me?

01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:31.254
<i>I think it was alright though.</i>

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.597
Who wants coffee?

01:32:33.918 --> 01:32:36.898
Actually I promised Ana
a tour of the grounds.

01:32:37.605 --> 01:32:38.681
Excuse us.

01:32:43.611 --> 01:32:46.788
Christian, I cannot walk
that fast in these shoes.

01:32:50.805 --> 01:32:52.247
When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?

01:32:52.471 --> 01:32:55.108
What? You have no right to be mad at me.

01:32:55.132 --> 01:32:57.322
Yeah but I am mad. Palm-twitchingly mad.

01:33:02.435 --> 01:33:04.922
You're mine. All mine. Understand?

01:33:12.358 --> 01:33:14.342
Christian, you're so confusing.

01:33:18.476 --> 01:33:20.356
- Ana.
- What do you want?

01:33:22.274 --> 01:33:24.560
- What do you want?
- I want you.

01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:27.120
I'm trying, Christian.

01:33:32.405 --> 01:33:33.578
I know you are.

01:33:34.568 --> 01:33:36.675
Why can't we sleep in the same bed?

01:33:37.614 --> 01:33:42.017
Why won't you let me touch you?
Why does it have to be like this?

01:33:49.670 --> 01:33:51.438
If you would just sign the
contract you wouldn't have...

01:33:51.473 --> 01:33:53.620
Why do you care so much about
the contract Christian?

01:33:53.644 --> 01:33:57.614
- Don't you like me the way I am?
- Of course I do.

01:33:57.638 --> 01:34:01.361
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not.

01:34:02.977 --> 01:34:06.531
- Its you.
- I need more, I want more.

01:34:08.246 --> 01:34:12.241
Hearts and flowers?
That's not something I know

01:34:14.432 --> 01:34:20.051
Ana please - its you that is changing me.

01:34:22.175 --> 01:34:25.961
Let me touch you. Let me.

01:34:40.428 --> 01:34:45.001
- Are they burns?
- I had a rough start in life.

01:34:45.425 --> 01:34:50.321
- That's all you need to know.
- Okay.

01:35:13.388 --> 01:35:18.139
The woman who gave birth to me,
was a crack addict.

01:35:19.391 --> 01:35:20.653
And a prostitute.

01:35:25.689 --> 01:35:27.483
She died when I was four.

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:38.117
I remember certain things. Terrible things.

01:35:42.384 --> 01:35:43.923
I don't remember her.

01:35:47.985 --> 01:35:53.700
Sometimes, I can see her in my dreams.

01:36:13.717 --> 01:36:15.457
Do you really have to go to Georgia?

01:36:20.139 --> 01:36:21.599
Yeah, I really.

01:36:44.615 --> 01:36:47.398
- This gazpacho is really salty Bob.
- Yeah.

01:36:47.422 --> 01:36:50.018
You'll get fat with all this sitting around
You tell him Ana.

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:53.081
- I'm not gonna tell him that.
- Yes thank you Ana.

01:36:53.105 --> 01:36:56.887
I'm just saying gazpacho
is in a bowl of salsa.

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:59.663
Now could you hand me some
chips for my bowl of salsa?

01:36:59.698 --> 01:37:01.114
You can have a carrot?

01:37:02.376 --> 01:37:04.247
What are you getting
at with this?

01:37:05.008 --> 01:37:08.768
You're lucky that I happen
to love you - very much.

01:37:08.792 --> 01:37:10.736
- I know that.
- Do you?

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.813
Hmm, I do.

01:38:48.906 --> 01:38:50.670
Oh darling, I think we
should pace ourselves,

01:38:50.731 --> 01:38:52.151
or at least order
something to eat.

01:38:52.175 --> 01:38:54.398
You go ahead,
 I'm not very hungry.

01:38:54.459 --> 01:38:56.809
Oh, I just have the fruit salad.

01:39:02.027 --> 01:39:05.585
- He can wait.
- Mom.

01:39:08.983 --> 01:39:10.563
- Holy fuck.
- What?

01:39:10.953 --> 01:39:12.114
What is it?

01:39:12.138 --> 01:39:17.050
Its Christian, he's here, in Georgia.

01:39:19.646 --> 01:39:22.263
- Here, here!
- Mrs Adams.

01:39:22.298 --> 01:39:23.595
Delighted to meet you.

01:39:23.819 --> 01:39:26.228
- Something to drink sir?
- Gin and tonic.

01:39:26.252 --> 01:39:28.793
Hendrix if you have it,
otherwise Bombay Sapphire.

01:39:28.817 --> 01:39:31.341
Cucumber with the Hendricks,
lime with Bombay.

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:34.810
- I like him already.
- What are you doing here Christian?

01:39:34.934 --> 01:39:38.178
- I came to see you.
- I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

01:39:48.943 --> 01:39:51.482
I broke rule 7, clause 5.

01:39:53.683 --> 01:39:58.842
We'll let it go, lets not talk
about the contract right now.

01:39:59.444 --> 01:40:00.905
How was your dinner?

01:40:04.683 --> 01:40:07.387
She's a friend, that's all.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.008
She knows me.

01:40:14.077 --> 01:40:18.807
- What did she advise you to do?
- Well I'm here.

01:40:21.447 --> 01:40:25.096
- Now what?
- I've got a room in this hotel.

01:40:27.117 --> 01:40:28.876
Well I hope you'll be comfortable in it.

01:40:33.501 --> 01:40:35.302
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?

01:40:40.977 --> 01:40:43.975
- Where are we going?
- Its a surprise.

01:40:44.568 --> 01:40:47.211
I think I've reached my quota of surprises.

01:40:48.819 --> 01:40:50.068
We're almost there.

01:40:58.006 --> 01:41:00.651
Mr Grey? Hey, I'll be your co-pilot.

01:41:00.675 --> 01:41:03.298
How do you do? This is my girlfriend,
Anastasia Steele.

01:41:34.670 --> 01:41:37.243
<i>We're at 400 feet, ready?</i>

01:41:37.567 --> 01:41:40.590
- Ready?
- Yes, ready.

01:41:40.814 --> 01:41:42.180
Release.

01:42:11.696 --> 01:42:12.904
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:18.782
- Is this more?
- Oh my god. So much more!

01:42:39.733 --> 01:42:44.247
Oh my god, that was incredible Christian.
Thank you.

01:42:44.371 --> 01:42:46.279
We aim to please Miss Steele.

01:42:47.293 --> 01:42:52.618
- I thought you didn't do romance.
- I don't. Ana.

01:42:52.642 --> 01:42:57.094
What? What?
Why are you fighting this?

01:43:00.296 --> 01:43:01.916
What are you afraid of?

01:43:12.421 --> 01:43:16.884
Grey. What? When?

01:43:19.125 --> 01:43:23.005
Have Stefan get the plane ready.
I'll be on the tarmac in 30 minutes.

01:43:23.429 --> 01:43:25.903
- What happened?
- I have to go back to Seattle.

01:43:26.427 --> 01:43:27.647
Come I'll take you home.

01:43:30.099 --> 01:43:32.168
Oh sweetheart, I wish
Christian could've stayed

01:43:32.203 --> 01:43:34.895
Bob was looking forward to meeting him.

01:43:34.919 --> 01:43:39.837
I know, he had to get back to Seattle
though. There's a um, situation at work.

01:43:39.861 --> 01:43:43.393
I wish I could tell you things get easier,
but they don't.

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:46.411
You just need to get to
know yourself better.

01:43:47.833 --> 01:43:50.615
- Thank you for everything mama.
- Take care.

01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:51.650
I will.

01:44:11.668 --> 01:44:14.682
You think I wouldn't recognise you Taylor?

01:44:14.872 --> 01:44:16.194
Right this way Miss Steele.

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:26.221
- How does he seem Taylor?
- Preoccupied I'm afraid.

01:44:27.034 --> 01:44:29.501
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.

01:44:35.768 --> 01:44:37.185
Well that's not gonna work.

01:44:39.521 --> 01:44:40.639
What?

01:44:42.655 --> 01:44:48.166
Well tell them they don't have 24 hours.
That is unacceptable.

01:44:48.190 --> 01:44:51.540
I need to know. Just keep me informed.

01:45:07.847 --> 01:45:13.426
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing that concerns you.

01:45:15.494 --> 01:45:17.888
- I can leave if you want me to go?
- No.

01:45:19.653 --> 01:45:21.335
That's the last thing I want.

01:45:27.908 --> 01:45:32.160
I want you, in the playroom, in 15 minutes.

01:46:00.075 --> 01:46:03.786
- What are your safe words?
- Red and yellow.

01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:05.306
Remember them.

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:19.176
That sounds so sad. Everything you play
sounds sad.

01:48:21.174 --> 01:48:22.981
You said you were six and when you learned,

01:48:23.042 --> 01:48:25.839
was it because you wanted
to please your new family?

01:48:34.525 --> 01:48:36.091
I just wanna talk.

01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:42.130
Why won't you let me in?

01:48:44.687 --> 01:48:47.248
- We should be talking.
- Like normal people?

01:48:47.631 --> 01:48:48.722
Yeah.

01:48:52.393 --> 01:48:53.860
Is that so wrong?

01:49:06.384 --> 01:49:09.479
Is this because of the contract?
Because I still haven't signed it?

01:49:10.123 --> 01:49:14.321
Fuck the contract, I think its a
little redundant don't you?

01:49:15.769 --> 01:49:17.912
So then the rules are redundant too?

01:49:18.182 --> 01:49:21.857
- No. The rules stand.
- And what if I break them?

01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:24.721
- Then there'll be consequences.
- Punishment?

01:49:25.224 --> 01:49:26.224
Yes.

01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:29.676
- Why do you want to punish me?
- Ana.

01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:31.673
Why do you want to hurt me?

01:49:34.806 --> 01:49:37.611
I would never do anything to you,
that you couldn't handle.

01:49:37.646 --> 01:49:40.626
But why do you even wanna do anything
at all to me Christian?

01:49:42.647 --> 01:49:45.868
If I told you, you'd never look at me
the same way again.

01:49:46.824 --> 01:49:50.316
So there is a reason. Tell me.

01:49:52.584 --> 01:49:54.790
- Do you wanna punish me right now?
- Yes.

01:49:55.114 --> 01:49:57.143
I wanna punish you right now.

01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:02.636
What if I told you that I feel the same
way about being punished as you

01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:05.262
do about me touching you, would
you still wanna punish me then?

01:50:07.917 --> 01:50:11.215
No. But that doesn't
mean I wouldn't need to.

01:50:11.344 --> 01:50:13.267
- Why?
- Ana stop.

01:50:13.291 --> 01:50:15.865
- Why do you need...
- Because its the way I am!

01:50:24.001 --> 01:50:26.140
Because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

01:50:49.391 --> 01:50:50.741
Show me then.

01:51:04.858 --> 01:51:09.861
I need you to show me, what
you wanna do to me.

01:51:10.512 --> 01:51:13.036
Punish me, show me how bad it can be.

01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.892
I want you to show me the worst.

01:51:22.964 --> 01:51:24.817
Its the only way I can understand.

01:51:38.919 --> 01:51:42.128
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

01:51:59.202 --> 01:52:00.375
Bend over.

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:13.625
I'm gonna hit you six times.
And you're gonna count with me.

01:52:26.095 --> 01:52:30.423
- Count, Anastasia.
- One.

01:52:36.295 --> 01:52:37.521
Two.

01:52:46.211 --> 01:52:47.211
Three.

01:52:58.072 --> 01:52:59.365
Four.

01:53:06.931 --> 01:53:08.143
Five.

01:53:22.012 --> 01:53:23.170
Six.

01:53:42.423 --> 01:53:46.298
Is this what you really want?
You wanna see me like this?

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.618
- Ana.
- Don't come near me.

01:53:57.654 --> 01:53:59.302
Does this give you pleasure?

01:54:02.599 --> 01:54:03.599
No.

01:54:08.849 --> 01:54:10.725
Don't you dare come near me.

01:55:14.793 --> 01:55:16.261
Please don't hate me.

01:55:19.446 --> 01:55:21.549
You will never do that to me again.

01:55:30.444 --> 01:55:35.524
- I'm not what you want.
- No, you are everything that I want.

01:55:44.338 --> 01:55:46.143
I've fallen in love with you.

01:55:50.173 --> 01:55:53.967
No. No, Ana. You can't love me.

01:56:07.383 --> 01:56:08.913
I need you to leave.

01:56:15.771 --> 01:56:16.982
Please.

01:57:11.219 --> 01:57:16.287
- I'd like my car back.
- Taylor already sold it.

01:57:18.668 --> 01:57:20.862
Then I'd like the money
he got for it please.

01:57:22.554 --> 01:57:23.908
I'll send you a check.

01:57:24.815 --> 01:57:25.815
Okay.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.341
Taylor will take you home.

01:57:51.238 --> 01:57:52.238
Stop.

01:57:52.927 --> 01:57:53.935
No!

01:58:09.332 --> 01:58:11.481
- Ana.
- Christian.
